Luwak 1.3.0
===========

The major change here is the introduction of the batching API, allowing users to
match several documents at once.  In general this will improve throughput at the
expense of latency, although as always you should measure timings carefully.

API changes:

* Added Monitor.match(DocumentBatch, MatcherFactory) and
  Monitor.debug(DocumentBatch, MatcherFactory) in addition to the existing
  InputDocument methods.
* QueryMatch now takes a document ID as well as a query ID
* Matches<T> exposes DocumentMatches<T> objects for document in an input batch
* Presearcher.buildQuery() now takes a QueryTermFilter rather than an
  IndexReaderContext for filtering out terms, and a LeafReader over a batch's
  document index rather than an InputDocument

New features:

* You can now configure Similarity implementations on a DocumentBatch
* Query metadata is passed to CandidateMatcher.doMatchQuery()
* DisjunctionMaxQuery can be highlighted
* DisjunctionMaxQuery can be decomposed and indexed separately
* Performance improvements: use TermsQuery for the document disjunction, and 
  filter out non-existent query terms before they're added to the query
* ConcurrentQueryLoader allows more efficient query loading on startup
* WildcardNGramPresearcherComponent makes it easier to adjust its max token
  length

Bug fixes:

* The slowlog was reporting nanosecond values as milliseconds
* FieldFilterPresearcherComponent didn't work for binary terms
* FieldFilterPresearcherComponent was breaking debug()
