Luwak 1.3.0
===========

API changes:

* Presearcher.buildQuery now takes a QueryTermFilter rather than an
  IndexReaderContext

New features:

* You can now configure different Similarity implementations on an InputDocument
* Query metadata is passed to CandidateMatcher.doMatchQuery()
* DisjunctionMaxQuery can be highlighted
* DisjunctionMaxQuery can be decomposed and indexed separately
* Performance improvements: use TermsQuery for the document disjunction, and 
  filter out non-existent query terms before they're added to the query
* ConcurrentQueryLoader allows more efficient query loading on startup
* WildcardNGramPresearcherComponent makes it easier to adjust its max token
  length

Bug fixes:

* The slowlog was reporting nanosecond values as milliseconds
* FieldFilterPresearcherComponent didn't work for binary terms
* FieldFilterPresearcherComponent was breaking debug()
